            <h2>Comaparison of Five Activity Trackers</h2>
            <p>Date: 22nd February 2015</p>
            <br>
            <p>With such a huge market to choose from, it is very difficult to decide which activity tracker is the one for you. This decision may be quite personal. For example if you goal is to improve the number of steps taken each day, then an activity tracker which accurately record your steps, and displays this information in an attractive manner may be the best choice for you. In the end it may come down to a combination of factors such as style, price, accuracy and ease-of-use. All activity trackers shown are primarily wore on your wrist. However for some devices, for example the Withings Pulse, the devices may be clipped to your trousers to track activity during the day</p>            
            <br>
    		<p>In this blog post we briefly examine five popular activity trackers. These are not neccessarily the five <i>best</i> activity trackers. However each one has generally proved popular, and each displays interesting features that the others may not neccessarily have. For example, the Fitbit Flex uses Bluetooth to wirelessly sync with a mobile phone or PC. Whereas the Jawbone UP must be pysically plugged in for the data to be gathered onto the Jawbone website.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Firstly, in order to understand a little more about what an "activity tracker" does, please view this short video. This is a promotional video released by Fitbit, but it gives a good overview of what these type of activity trackers can do:</p>

            <br>
            <p>In the largest market for activity trackers (the US), Fitbit which is headquartered in San Francisco California, leads the way.  Statistics from 2013 show that Fibit dominates the market with 58%, followed by Jawbone 21% and Nike 14%. Others 8%.</p>

            <br>            
            
            <p>In summary, this is a very interesting field. Without having personally tried each of the activity trackers, it is difficult for this author to tell which is the "best". Furthermore different people have different requirements, and budgets. Certainly the Fitbit Flex proved very popular and it is easy to see why as it seems to provide excellent value for money. The Withings Pulse easily collects heartrate data, and along with Withings other products, such as blood pressure monitors and weighing scales, makes this company very exciting to watch. The Jawbone Up is the most stylish device in the author's opinion. The Nike Fuelband is particularly good for tracking activity, but by some accounts the sleep tracking is not as accurate. Finally the Basis B1 collects data which many of the the other devices do not.</p>
