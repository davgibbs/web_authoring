        	<p>Welcome to WebMyHealth! This website provides user with information regarding wearable activity trackers. An activity tracker is a device or application for monitoring and tracking fitness-related metrics such as distance walked or run, calorie consumption, and in some cases heartbeat and quality of sleep. The market for activity trackers is growing at a remarkable rate, and exciting improvements to products are available to the consumer each month.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This is a website which tries to encourage users to track their own health on the World Wide Web, Hence the website name. By doing so, the information is easily accessible to you anywhere you go! It is also available to your doctors, physiotherapists, nuitrionists, caring family members, etc. Once this type of data is being gathered, it provides invaluable data for you to make decisions to improve your health and quality -of-life.</p>
            <br>
            
        	<p>This website is broken down into four main headers as detailed in the navigation bar above. Essentially the goal of each is as follows:</p>        
            <h4>Home</h4>
            <p>The page provides an landing page for the website. It tries to ensure that you have a positive experience on the website by providing a sitemap which links to every page on this website</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Data</h4>
            <p>Often it is possible to download the data collected in csv format. The page attempts to give the website visitor a view of the type of data gathered by activity trackers by displaying almost one and a half years. Real data (from the website author's own fitbit flex!) is presented. The data was gathered by the Fitbit Flex and then retrieved from the fitbit website in csv format. Daily data for the period 10th September 2013 until 14th February 2015 is displayed across four data sources: Daily Step, Daily Active Minutes, Daily Calories Burned, Daily Distance. On this website the data can be viewed in a graph format of sortable table. It can also be compared to a target value, which was set by the author. This can help determine, for each data source, how often the target is met.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Blog</h4>
            <p>The blog home page contains links to all the blog entries posted. The blog examining is intended to allow for postd examing all aspects of the <i>health tracking</i> area. Currently there is only one blog entry which was made on 22nd February. This entry compares five popular fitness trackers: Fitbit Flex, Nike Fuelband, Withings Pulse, Jawbone Up, and Basis B1. It discusses the positives and limitations of each, and provides more information on each. There also a video available to introduce the visitor to the Fitbit Flex activity tracker.</p>
            <br>
