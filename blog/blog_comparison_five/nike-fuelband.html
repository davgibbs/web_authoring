  				<h1>Nike Fuelband</h1>
            	<p>Released in November 2013, the Nike+ FuelBand is a fitness tracker of the Nike+ product line which, worn on the wrist, records daily activity (steps) and the burned calories. With the web app you can set up a personal goal - if you achieve it, it will be visualized via the color display on the wrist band. It is to be used with an Apple iPhone, iPad or Android device.</p>
                <br>
				<p>As part of the Quantified Self movement, the FuelBand allows its wearers to track their physical activity, steps taken daily, and amount of energy burned. The information from the wristband is integrated into the Nike+ online community and phone application, allowing wearers to set their own fitness goals, monitor their progression, and compare themselves to others part of the community. Nike+ relies on the gamification of fitness activities turning all tracked movement into NikeFuel points, which can unlock achievements, can be shared with friends, or can be used to engage others in competition. Nike is reportedly axing its Fuelband, for evolving digital priorities.</p>
