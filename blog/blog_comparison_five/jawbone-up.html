  	    	<h1>Jawbone Up</h1>
            <p>Launched in November 2011, UP by Jawbone is an activity tracker, the company's first non-audio product. It consists of a flexible rubber-coated wristband and accompanying iPhone and Android app</p>
            <br>
			<p>UP allows users to track their sleep, eating habits, and daily activity including steps taken and calories burned. The wristband is water-resistant and designed to be worn 24/7, with a rechargeable battery that lasts for up to 10 days at a time. The wristband also features a vibration motor that can be programmed as an alarm to wake users in the best phase of their natural sleep cycle, or act as a reminder when users have been sedentary too long. The UP app includes a social-networking platform designed to add an extra layer of motivation within the system. UP users can view their friends' data and engage in challenges with other users.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The headphone jack is used for both syncing of data and charging this activity tracker.</p>
