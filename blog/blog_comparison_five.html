            <h2>Comaparison of 5 Wearables</h2>
            <p>Date: 22nd February 2015</p>
            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>With such a huge market to choose from, it is very difficult to decide which activity tracker is the one for you. This decision may be quite personal. For example if you goal is to improve the number of steps taken each day, then an activity tracker which accurately record your step, and displays this information in an attractive manner may be the best choice for you. In the end it may come down to a combination of factors such as style, price, accuracy and ease-of-use. All activity trackers shown are primarily wore on your wrist. However for some devices, for example the Withings Pulse, the devices may be clipped to your trousers to track activity during the day</p>
            
            <br>
    		<p>In this blog post we examine 5 popular wearable activity trackers. These are not neccessarily the five <i>best</i> activity trackers. However each one has generally been popular, and each displays interesting features that the others may not neccessarily have. For example, the Fitbit Flex uses Bluetooth to wirelessly sync with a mobile phone or PC. Whereas the Jawbone UP must be pysically plugged in for the data to be gathered onto the Jawbone website.</p>
            
            <p>Firstly, in order to understand a little more about what an "activity tracker" does, please view this short video. This is a promotional video released by Fitbit, but it gives a good overview of what these type of activity trackers can do:</p>
