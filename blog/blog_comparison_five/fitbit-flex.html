				<h1>Fitbit Flex</h1>
                <p>Released in May 2013 Flex by Fitbit is a flexible wrist band which includes a sensor to record activities and sleep. It tracks movement 24 hours a day, including sleep patterns.  The data collected is similar to the Fitbit One, the previous product release by Fitbit. Data includes: Steps taken, Distance covered, Calories burned, Active minutes, Sleep (hours slept, times awoken, sleep efficiency).<p>
                <br>              
                <p>The flex can wake you up with a silent vibration alarm. The device allows the sensor to be removed and used with other colours of flex wrist bands. Contrary to the One the Flex can't be used to count stairs climbed. It is synchronized via bluetooth and can be used via the Fitbit app.</p>
                <br>              
                <p>It has a simple display of 5 LED lights which indicate the number of steps taken in a day, and it vibrates to indicate that your goal has been reached. The lights also indicate battery level. The Fitbit Flex has almost all the same sync functions as the Fitbit One and Zip (another previous product). The Flex is also the most water-resistant tracker; it can be worn while showering and swimming. The Fitbit flex includes a specialized USB charger; the battery lasts 5–7 days, and it takes 1–2 hours to charge.</p>
